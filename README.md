# 1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

I was sent the project around 4pm yesterday and the recruiter told me he wanted it submited 4pm today. I had to work on it for less than a day.
If I had more time, I would have implemented some testing. Also I did not have enough time to parse the date received form the API to render it appropriately

# To track down performance issue, I will need to confirm when they exist and have sufficient conext to figure out what was going wrong

# The APi call seems to be very slow. Top improve it I will use Caching
